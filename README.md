### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development
- Mapping arrays and objects
- React router

### Useful resources

- [Freaky Jolly](https://www.freakyjolly.com/react-add-active-class-on-selected-item-on-dynamic-list/) - This helped me for setting active class. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Geek for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-typewriter-effect-in-reactjs/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the typewriter effect. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
